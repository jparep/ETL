## Introduction
This guide outlines the steps to create a modern ETL data pipeline that leverages AWS Lambda for serverless computing, Pandas for data manipulation, and dbt for data transformation and validation. The final data is loaded into Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing solution.

## Architecture
The architecture of the ETL pipeline consists of the following components:
- AWS Lambda functions to handle data extraction and loading.
- Pandas for data transformation and manipulation.
- dbt (data build tool) for testing and validating data integrity.
- Snowflake as the data warehouse for storing the processed data.


## Components

### AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. It is used for extracting data from various sources and loading it into Snowflake.

### Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It is used for cleaning, transforming, and manipulating the data before it is loaded into Snowflake.

### dbt
dbt (data build tool) is used for transforming the data within the data warehouse and ensuring data integrity through testing and validation.

### Snowflake
Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing solution that provides high performance, scalability, and concurrency. It is used to store the final processed data.

## Setup and Configuration
1. **AWS Lambda**: Set up AWS Lambda functions to extract data from sources and load it into Snowflake.
2. **Pandas**: Install Pandas and use it within the Lambda functions for data transformation.
3. **dbt**: Configure dbt to connect to Snowflake and define models for data transformation and validation.
4. **Snowflake**: Set up a Snowflake account and create the necessary tables and schemas for storing the data.

## Data Pipeline Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**: AWS Lambda functions extract data from various sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: Use Pandas within the Lambda functions to clean and transform the data.
3. **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data into Snowflake using AWS Lambda.
4. **Data Validation**: Use dbt to run tests and validate the data integrity within Snowflake.

## Testing and Validation
- Define dbt models to transform the data within Snowflake.
- Create dbt tests to ensure data quality and integrity.
- Run dbt commands to execute the transformations and tests.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can create a modern ETL data pipeline using AWS Lambda, Pandas, and dbt to ensure data integrity before loading it into Snowflake. This approach leverages serverless computing, powerful data manipulation, and robust data validation to build a reliable and scalable data pipeline.
